              I am currently extremely interested in virtual reality development under <a class = "experience-header-blurb" target = "_blank" href= "https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n49bd3fdd/Persons/View%20All">Dr. Jinsil Hwaryoung Seo</a> at <a  class = "experience-header-blurb" href="https://softinteraction.com/" target = "_blank">Soft Interaction Lab</a>. The main development tools for these projects are <a class = "experience-header-blurb" href="https://store.facebook.com/quest" target = "_blank">Meta Quest</a> headsets and <a class = "experience-header-blurb"  href="https://unity.com/" target = "_blank">Unity 3D</a>. I am currently working on two main projects. <a  class = "experience-header-blurb" href="https://github.tamu.edu/alexiahassantamu123/PPH-VR" target = "_blank">PPH-VR</a> is a training simulation which runs through procedures during Postpartum Hemorrhage emergencies. Since medical simulations are very hands-on, we are also using <a class = "experience-header-blurb" href="https://www.senseglove.com/product/nova/" target = "_blank">SenseGlove Nova</a> haptic gloves to provide a truly immersive experience. These gloves use motion-restriction to simulate the sensations of grabbing, holding, and touching objects. The PPH-VR application trains nurses to perform a fundal massage, a live-saving technique for critical postpartum hemorrhage emergencies. Using Meta Quest controllers, users are able to understand an overview of the procedure even with mild abstraction during the massage itself- the haptic gloves eliminate this abstraction for an accurate, realistic training experience.
      
              <br><br>From 2018-2020, I worked at <a  class = "experience-header-blurb" href="https://icodeschool.com/dallas103/" target = "_blank">iCode North Dallas</a> as a lead laboratory mentor, Instructor, and digital advertisement creator. I had the opportunity to teach hundreds of wonderful kids about subjects including programming, robotics, digital art, game design, 3D modeling, and more. It led me to realize my passion for education and learning, and allowed me to further develop my own leadership and collaboration skills by working in teams and managing other laboratory mentors to run successful programs.
              
              <br><br>I am also grateful to be a part of an <a class = "experience-header-blurb" href="https://innovation.tamu.edu/innovation-x/current-projects/" target = "_blank">Innovation [X]</a> project from 2022-2023. This project will focus on creating vicarious experiences in virtual reality for people with disabilities in conjunction with <a class = "experience-header-blurb" href="https://aggieachieve.tamu.edu/" target = "_blank">Aggie Achievers</a> at Texas A&M University. Virtual reality is a phenomenal platform to allow people with different disabilities to experience things they otherwise might be unable to. Working closely with 3D artists and special education specialists, and most importantly with Aggie Achievers themselves, we can create an exciting application that knows no limits.      
              
              <br><br>My technical skills include Java, Python, C++, C#, HTML/CSS, Unity, GitHub, VR Development, Photoshop, and more.
