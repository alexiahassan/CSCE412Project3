        Hi there, my name is Alexia Hassan. I've always had a facination with computers and programming, and I've made it my mission to combine technical skill with creative implementation. Growing up lost in books, I became passionate about story telling and writing, and picked up a love for digital and traditional art. Once I was exposed to video games and the immersive cathartic experiences they provide, I became hooked on programming for both practical and creative reasons.
