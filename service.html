              My community and university do so much for me, and that is why I am to give back through service. Some of my current service projects include maintaining the <a class = "service-blurb" href = "https://www.membershpe.org/" target = "_blank">MemberSHPE</a> portal for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, as well as writing a personal website guide for aggie SHPE members to convey their professional presence. Service areas I am interested in are engineering education for children at schools, and working with people who have disabilities.
